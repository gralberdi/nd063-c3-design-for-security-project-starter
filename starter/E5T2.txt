# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Cfripper: Library and CLI security analyzer for AWS CloudFormation templates

### Example vulnerability

As a part of the default rules for check vulnerabilities:

GenericResourceFullWildcardPrincipalRule: Checks for any wildcard principal 
defined in any statement. 

Risk: It might allow other AWS identities to escalate privileges.
Fix: Where possible, restrict the access to only the required resources. 
For example, instead of Principal: "*", include a list of the roles that need 
access.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

For AMI's for OS vulnerabilities we have AWS Inspector:  is intended to 
specifically analyze and report on vulnerabilities on EC2 instances. The type of 
scanning that inspector provides is considered static scanning.

For containers vulnerabilities we have Clair:  static analysis of vulnerabilities 
in application containers.


### Example vulnerability

AWS Inspector: 
Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway:
On the instance i-0cdf6b917aa25ed6d, the port range 22-22 is reachable from the 
InternetGateway igw-0c58bfff352be0ff2 from an attached ENI eni-0622ae75879d34dd3.


##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config: a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the 
configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records 
your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of r
ecorded configurations against desired configurations. With Config, you can 
review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive 
into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall 
compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.


### Example vulnerability

Non compliant rule securityhub-s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled-e8413d5b:

Checks that your Amazon S3 bucket either has Amazon S3 default encryption 
enabled or that the S3 bucket policy 
explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.
