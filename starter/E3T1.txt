# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

I have been waiting for more than 2 hours a no findings in GuarfDuty. I read
several comments on MENTOR HELP about there are sometimes that GuardDuty do not
show any findings.

I can not complete this tasks as is required.


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Amazon GuardDuty has several "data sources"; one of them is "VPC Flow Logs," 
The VPC Flow Logs feature of Amazon VPC captures information about the IP 
traffic going to and from network interfaces within your environment. 

When GuardDuty is enabled, it immediately starts analyzing your VPC flow logs
data. It consumes VPC flow log events directly from the VPC Flow Logs feature 
through an independent and duplicative stream of flow logs. This process does 
not affect any existing flow log configurations that you might have.
