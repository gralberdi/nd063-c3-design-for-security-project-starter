Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload
 data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor 
 practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The most obvious poor practice related to security is to deploy WebService 
Instance in public network, being accesible directly from Internet access This 
is not necesary (it is a security risk) even this instance is behind a 
Application Load Balancer. 

Also, the Application Load Balancer is configured to HTTP on port 80 instead of 
HTTPS on port 443 to encrypts the traffic to/from Internet to the web 
application.

The Security Group, WebAppSG, assigned to WebService Instance, expose 
port 22 (SSH) and port 5000 (web application instance port listener) to the 
Internet. Exposing SSH to Internet is a security risk.

If WebService Instnace was deployed in private network, this seciruty issues
 will be minimized.

Another poor practice related to security is to use HTTP load balancer on 
port 80 instead of HTTPS on port 443 to encrypts the traffic to/from Internet 
to the web application.

# Poor practice 2
The InstanceRolePolicy-C3 defined in the InstanceRole assigned to the WebService 
Instance by InstanceProfileRole violates the least privilege principle. It allow 
any action to any S3 resource. 

This allow the WebService Instance to grant access to the S3BucketRecipesSecret, 
and it is a requirement that WebService Instance do not need access to 
S3BucketRecipesSecret. Access to this bucket must be granted only to privileged 
business users, and must not be accesible from web application.

In addition, InstanceRolePolicy-C3, allow any action, and the WebService 
Instance only need read action to S3BucketRecipesFree.
