# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

We could move the WebService Instance to a private subnet. There is no direct 
access from the Internet to the instance.

As a best practice, production servers should not have SSH enabled, so we should 
also remove the SSH access to this instance. 


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Using VPC private endopints for S3 will prevent that any user not authenticated
will not get access to de secrets bucket. But any user authenticated will get
access. To prevent this, we must enforce the solution with policy and permissions
to IAM Roles, to manage specific users to get authorized access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, it will not. Enabling default encryption to a bucket will only encrypt new 
objects that we put into the bucket after that. This setting does not affect the 
objects already stored in the bucket


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The changes made through the console or the CLI would be loosing, and the 
settings wiil be reset from the original CloudFormation templates
